### Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future

* *What very important truth do few people agree with you on? (5)*   
  One of Thiel's go-to interview questions--tough intellectually because the truths that schools teach are common ones, and tough psychologically because
  it's difficult to argue an unpopular opinion.

* *If nothing about our society changes fo the next 100 years, then the future
  is over 100 years away. (6)*   
  A clever pithy. Good reminder that we can't take progress for granted. He harkens back to Americans in the 60's, echoing their expectations of "a four-day workweek, energy too cheap to meter, and vacations on the moon" (9). Damn... all they got instead were smaller computer chips. And just looking around at subways, street lights, buildings and houses, trash cans and sewage systems, even the way we cook and clean and work out... it does seem like our surroundings are "strangely old". Taken from Elon, perhaps?

* Horizontal vs Vertical Progress   
  Horizontal being copying "things that work", aka taking ideas from 1 to n, or globalisation; vertical being creating new things, aka going from 0 to 1, or technology. While we may find hope in horizontal progress, he argues that there simply aren't enough resources. "Globalisation without new technology is unsustainable" (9).

* The Power of 0 to 1   
  Primitive humans lived in a zero-sum society. Creating technology is how we add new sources of wealth, and thus increase the total.

* The Power of Staying Small   
  He punctuates the chapter by explaining why it takes a small company to produce technology. What is a fairly standard assessment nowadays. "A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future" (10).

* Some Reflections   
  Of course he's gonna talk about the next GAFA, but what about the 99.9% of startups whose mission is "just to" automate some testing framework, add a new feature to Postgres, buffer payments between a service and users? Where do they belong in his extensive/intensive binary? It's pretty hard not to get swept up in Thiel's grandiose visions and eulogies on immortality, but in practice most of us are rarely concerned with such idealisms. Helps one sell books (and stir up sidelined dreams), I guess.   
  This reminds me of Nietzsche's "The object of Mankind should lie in its highest individuals" (from *Schopenhauer as Educator*). Individual achievement--yet another example of the power law in the flesh. 


### Chapter 2: Party Like It's 1999

* *"Madness is rare in individuals--but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule," Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). (12)*     
  Thus, a good way of finding contrarian truths is identifying what everyone agrees on. He gives as example the 1990's "New Economy", where it became commonplace for companies to assume heavy losses for popularity metrics like page views. As we know now, such thinking turned out to be a bubble (a conventional but incorrect belief).

* *But the distortion caused by bubbles don't disappear when they pop. (13)*      
  Interesting point here--and to a certain extent, we've taken measures aimed at avoiding the 2008 crisis (less voluntary regulation), but Thiel asks us to question if (1) we're misidentifying the causes of the crash, and (2) what could go wrong with a more-regulation approach? "The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past" (13).

* A Quick History    
  The 90's: US recession, jobs going to Mexico, dead soldiers, grunge & heroin, East Asian crises, the ruble fails, the euro fails, everything fails but IT. Then 18 months of dot-com mania, of sketchy startups and limitless money and red ink trophies. "But it's hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing" (17).

* Paypal's Beginnings   
  The idea was to facilitate payments between PalmPilots. Turns out the market's too sparse, so let's pivot to email instead. Pay people to sign up and refer friends. Secured funding right before the bubble burst.

* Reactive Measures   
  He lists 4 big mindset changes people made in response to the dot-com crash:
  * Make incremental advances (don't get cocky)
  * Stay lean (don't plan, it's all just "agnostic experimentation")
  * Improve on the competition (stick with existing markets)
  * Product, not sales (true technology distributes itself).

* Reactive Measures are wrong   
  Maybe. He suggests that the alternative beliefs are no less valid:
  * Risk boldness
  * A bad plan is better than no plan
  * No profits in competition (see Chapter 4)
  * Sales matters (see Chapter 11).

* Some Reflections   
  The dogmas he talks about didn't end up lasting very long. I mean what's different about the bubble we're in now? Agile methodologies? The blind funding, viral marketing, early-stage losses, it all seems like that ethos has returned. Long live the dreamer.


### Chapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different

* Airlines vs Google      
  "Creating value is not enough--you also need to capture some of the value you create" (23). Airline margins are less than 1 percent; Google's is over 20. Why is that? Monopoly.

* Perfect Competition    
  What Econ 101 preaches to be the ideal state of a free market. But in reality, perfect competition means no firm has any competitive edge or market power, so any margins would be quickly equilibrated away as new firms enter the market. So "in the long run *no company makes an economic profit*" (24).

* Monopoly    
  How profits are actually made. He asserts that "capitalism and competition are opposites"; in other words, monopoly is the backbone of capitalism (25). In fact, "*monopoly is the condition of every successful business*" (34). The lesson here? Look for markets you can dominate. 

* *Lies People Tell (25)*    
  So why is this truth about competition and monopolies so well hidden? Because both competitive firms and monopolies want it that way. As competitive firms scramble to differentiate themselves, they'll do anything to convince people that they're in "a league of their own", that there's no competition (28). A competitive firm that wants to look like a monopoly will define their market to specific intersection of several markets (e.g. British food in Palo Alto).      
  Conversely, true monopolists need to hide their identity in order to survive. They'll do anything to make sure no audits or investigations are sent their way, and this usually means hyping up imaginary sources of competition. A monopoly that wants to look like it has competition will define their market to be a general union of several markets (multifaceted tech vs search ads).

* *In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything (31)*    
  For firms in competition, it's everything. Any long term plans are jettisoned in the face of "daily brute struggle for survival" (32). Monopoly profits, on the other hand, affords one the bandwidth to think about larger visions like R&D and social good.

* But Aren't Monopolies Bad?     
  We're taught that monopolies are bad because they can raise prices arbitrarily (*cough cough* big pharma). But this is only the case "*in a world where nothing changes*" (32). In the real world, creative monopolies open up new markets and avenues for creation, from which new companies can innovate further. He gives as example the IBM-Microsoft-Apple lineage.    
  So why are economists blind to this fact? Personally, I don't think they are. Thiel ventures a guess, but ends up just dribbling out some empty wordplay with allusions to physics (smh Pete).


### Chapter 4: The Ideology of Competition

* In School
  A few pages ranting about the education system, nothing new here. His point is that schools funnel students' mindsets into competing for artificially-competitive accolades. His was a Supreme Court clerkship, and he credits his success in entrepreneurship to not getting that clerkship.  "All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past" (37). Ouch.

* In Business
  Business, unlike schools, is quite proud of its cutthroat-competitive nature. Clausewitz and Sun Tzu, must-reads for the modern MBA. War lingo like *headhunters*, *sales force*, *captive markets*, and *making a killing* pervade the language. "But really it's competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive" (37).

* On the Origins of Competition, featuring Marx and Shakespeare
  For Marx, competition arises out of difference. Class difference produces class conflict.
  For Shakespeare, conflict is rather arbitrary: combatants are more or less the same. "It's not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about"--look no further than *Romeo and Juliet* (38).

* So Who's Right
  In business, he argues, Shakespeare's model is more accurate. People within a firm compete for career advancement. Firms compete for market share. Everything revolves around conquering the rivals. I'm reminded of a line from Conan:
  *Barbarian General: “Conan, what is best in life?”*
  *Conan: “To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women!”*

* Why Competition is Bad
  * Reason 1: because others are waiting. Take Microsoft and Google. As they grew, the two companies began to focus more and more on each other. Windows vs Chrome OS. Bing vs Google Search. Office vs Docs. Explorer vs Chrome. Surface vs Nexus. Burdened by competition, they were helpless to stop Apple going right past them. 
  * Reason 2: because it limits your thinking. After Square came out with its mobile card reader, every other payment service raced to belch out its own.
  * Reason 3: because you compete over nothing. He brings up the online pet store mania of the 90's, where dozens of firms clawed tooth and nail over a nonexistent market, and everyone lost.
  * Reason 4: because it's not necessary. He gives the story of PayPal merging with X.com. Despite indentical products and intense competition (working just 4 blocks apart), he and Elon decided to come together to brave a bigger enemy, the inflating tech bubble.

* Human Nature is Bad
  Fighting over things that don't matter (as Shakespeare put it, "even for an eggshell"), is an intensely human phenomenon. But for Thiel, this is disastrous is business. It seems like he's talking about putting aside one's pride and not fighting for the sake of ego; something that's often extolled in theory, and yet just as often negated by counterexamples of successful people with *massive* egos (in fact, try and think of someone that doesn't). Perhaps, then, it's about recognizing competitiveness as as addictive force, and indulging it with patience and macro-level strategies. This contradiction of being crazy and having a clear mind at the same time is something he hints at later on in describing successful founders.
