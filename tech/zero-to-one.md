### Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future

* *What very important truth do few people agree with you on? (5)*   
  One of Thiel's go-to interview questions--tough intellectually because the truths that schools teach are common ones, and tough psychologically because
  it's difficult to argue an unpopular opinion.

* *If nothing about our society changes fo the next 100 years, then the future
  is over 100 years away. (6)*   
  A clever, pithy reminder that we can't take progress for granted. He harkens back to Americans in the 60's, echoing their expectations of "a four-day workweek, energy too cheap to meter, and vacations on the moon" (9). Damn... all they got instead were smaller computer chips. And just looking around at subways, street lights, buildings and houses, trash cans and sewage systems, even the way we cook and clean and work out... it does seem like our surroundings are "strangely old". Taken from Elon, perhaps?

* Horizontal vs Vertical Progress   
  Horizontal being copying "things that work", aka taking ideas from 1 to n, or globalisation; vertical being creating new things, aka going from 0 to 1, or technology. While we may find hope in horizontal progress, he argues that there simply aren't enough resources. "Globalisation without new technology is unsustainable" (9).

* The Power of 0 to 1   
  Primitive humans lived in a zero-sum society. Creating technology is how we add new sources of wealth, and thus increase the total.

* The Power of Staying Small   
  He punctuates the chapter by explaining why it takes a small company to produce technology. What is a fairly standard assessment nowadays. "A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future" (10).

* Some Reflections   
  Of course he's gonna talk about the next GAFA, but what about the 99.9% of startups whose mission is "just to" automate some testing framework, add a new feature to Postgres, buffer payments between a service and users? Where do they belong in his extensive/intensive binary? It's pretty hard not to get swept up in Thiel's grandiose visions and eulogies on immortality, but in practice most of us are rarely concerned with such idealisms. Helps one sell books (and stir up sidelined dreams), I guess.   
  This reminds me of Nietzsche's "The object of Mankind should lie in its highest individuals" (from *Schopenhauer as Educator*). Individual achievement--yet another example of the power law in the flesh. 


### Chapter 2: Party Like It's 1999

* *"Madness is rare in individuals--but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule," Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). (12)*     
  Thus, a good way of finding contrarian truths is identifying what everyone agrees on. He gives as example the 1990's "New Economy", where it became commonplace for companies to assume heavy losses for popularity metrics like page views. As we know now, such thinking turned out to be a bubble (a conventional but incorrect belief).

* *But the distortion caused by bubbles don't disappear when they pop. (13)*      
  Interesting point here--and to a certain extent, we've taken measures aimed at avoiding the 2008 crisis (less voluntary regulation), but Thiel asks us to question if (1) we're misidentifying the causes of the crash, and (2) what could go wrong with a more-regulation approach? "The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past" (13).

* A Quick History    
  The 90's: US recession, jobs going to Mexico, dead soldiers, grunge & heroin, East Asian crises, the ruble fails, the euro fails, everything fails but IT. Then 18 months of dot-com mania, of sketchy startups and limitless money and red ink trophies. "But it's hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing" (17).

* Paypal's Beginnings   
  The idea was to facilitate payments between PalmPilots. Turns out the market's too sparse, so let's pivot to email instead. Pay people to sign up and refer friends. Secured funding right before the bubble burst.

* Reactive Measures   
  He lists 4 big mindset changes people made in response to the dot-com crash:
  * Make incremental advances (don't get cocky)
  * Stay lean (don't plan, it's all just "agnostic experimentation")
  * Improve on the competition (stick with existing markets)
  * Product, not sales (true technology distributes itself).

* Reactive Measures are wrong   
  Maybe. He suggests that the alternative beliefs are no less valid:
  * Risk boldness
  * A bad plan is better than no plan
  * No profits in competition (see Chapter 4)
  * Sales matters (see Chapter 11).

* Some Reflections   
  The dogmas he talks about didn't end up lasting very long. I mean what's different about the bubble we're in now? Agile methodologies? The blind funding, viral marketing, early-stage losses, it all seems like that ethos has returned. Long live the dreamer.


### Chapter 3: All Happy Companies Are Different

* Airlines vs Google      
  "Creating value is not enough--you also need to capture some of the value you create" (23). Airline margins are less than 1 percent; Google's is over 20. Why is that? Monopoly.

* Perfect Competition    
  What Econ 101 preaches to be the ideal state of a free market. But in reality, perfect competition means no firm has any competitive edge or market power, so any margins would be quickly equilibrated away as new firms enter the market. So "in the long run *no company makes an economic profit*" (24).

* Monopoly    
  How profits are actually made. He asserts that "capitalism and competition are opposites"; in other words, monopoly is the backbone of capitalism (25). In fact, "*monopoly is the condition of every successful business*" (34). The lesson here? Look for markets you can dominate. 

* *Lies People Tell (25)*    
  So why is this truth about competition and monopolies so well hidden? Because both competitive firms and monopolies want it that way. As competitive firms scramble to differentiate themselves, they'll do anything to convince people that they're in "a league of their own", that there's no competition (28). A competitive firm that wants to look like a monopoly will define their market to specific intersection of several markets (e.g. British food in Palo Alto).      
  Conversely, true monopolists need to hide their identity in order to survive. They'll do anything to make sure no audits or investigations are sent their way, and this usually means hyping up imaginary sources of competition. A monopoly that wants to look like it has competition will define their market to be a general union of several markets (multifaceted tech vs search ads).

* *In business, money is either an important thing or it is everything (31)*    
  For firms in competition, it's everything. Any long term plans are jettisoned in the face of "daily brute struggle for survival" (32). Monopoly profits, on the other hand, affords one the bandwidth to think about larger visions like R&D and social good.

* But Aren't Monopolies Bad?     
  We're taught that monopolies are bad because they can raise prices arbitrarily (*cough cough* big pharma). But this is only the case "*in a world where nothing changes*" (32). In the real world, creative monopolies open up new markets and avenues for creation, from which new companies can innovate further. He gives as example the IBM-Microsoft-Apple lineage.    
  So why are economists blind to this fact? Personally, I don't think they are. Thiel ventures a guess, but ends up just dribbling out some empty wordplay with allusions to physics (smh Pete).


### Chapter 4: The Ideology of Competition

* In School    
  A few pages ranting about the education system (nothing new here). His point is that schools funnel students' mindsets into competing for artificially-competitive accolades. For him it was a Supreme Court clerkship, and he credits his success in entrepreneurship to not getting that clerkship.  "All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past" (37). Ouch.

* In Business    
  Business, unlike schools, is remarkably proud of its cutthroat-competitive nature. Clausewitz and Sun Tzu are must-reads for the modern MBA. War lingo like *headhunters*, *sales force*, *captive markets*, and *making a killing* pervade the language. "But really it's competition, not business, that is like war: allegedly necessary, supposedly valiant, but ultimately destructive" (37).

* On the Origins of Competition, featuring Marx and Shakespeare    
  For Marx, competition arises out of difference. Class difference produces class conflict.    
  For Shakespeare, conflict is rather arbitrary: combatants are more or less the same. "It's not at all clear why they should be fighting, since they have nothing to fight about"--look no further than *Romeo and Juliet* (38).

* So Who's Right    
  In business, he argues, Shakespeare's model is more accurate. People within a firm compete for career advancement. Firms compete for market share. Goals and plans are defined vis-à-vis the opposition. I'm reminded of a line from Conan:    
  *Barbarian General (Akio Mitamura): “Conan, what is best in life?”*    
  *Conan (Arnold Schwarzenegger): “To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women!”*

* Why Competition is Bad    
  * **Reason 1:** because others are waiting. Take the rivalry between Microsoft and Google: Windows vs Chrome OS, Bing vs Google Search, Office vs Docs, Explorer vs Chrome, Surface vs Nexus. Burdened by competition, they've let Apple slip right past them. 
  * **Reason 2:** because it limits your thinking. After Square came out with its mobile card reader, every other payment service raced to belch out its own, instead of building something better.
  * **Reason 3:** because you compete over nothing. He brings up the online pet store mania of the 90's, where dozens of firms clawed tooth-and-nail over a nonexistent market, and everyone lost.
  * **Reason 4:** because it's not necessary. He gives the story of PayPal merging with X.com. Despite indentical products and intense competition (working just 4 blocks apart), he and Elon decided to come together to brave a bigger enemy, the rapidly-inflating tech bubble.

* Human Nature is Bad    
  Fighting over things that don't matter (as Shakespeare puts it, "even for an eggshell"), is an intensely human phenomenon. But for Thiel, this proves disastrous in business. It seems like he's talking about putting aside one's pride and not fighting for the sake of ego; something that's often extolled in theory, and yet just as often negated by counterexamples of successful people who rely on massive egos--Jobs, Kobe, Ye... Perhaps, then, it's about recognizing competitiveness as as addictive force, and indulging it with patience and within macro-level strategies (another reason why those with "Asperger's-like social ineniptitude" seem to have an advantage in the Valley). This contradiction of being crazy and having a clear mind at the same time is something he mulls over later on in describing successful founders.


### Chapter 5: Building a Monopoly

* Life's a Marathon    
  Companies are valued based on their "ability to generate cash flows *in the future*" (44). This explains why the NYT makes more money (right now) than Twitter, but is valued at far less. Therefore in tech, it pays to focus on long-term development rather than day-to-day turbulence.    
  This can be difficult in a world of measurement mania. "Growth is easy to measure, but durability isn't"; examples like Zynga and Groupon remind us that good short-term metrics are no guarantee for long-term prosperity if the business plan is fundamentally lacking (47).

* Characteristics of a Monopoly    
  * **Proprietary Technology:** Arguably the most important, as it ensures your value prop can't be easily replicated. Thiel defines proprietary as at least an order of magnitude better than the current alternative. The easiest way to do this, of course, is to create something new (for theoretically-infinite improvement); otherwise, you gotta build on existing solutions: PayPal made eBay transactions 10x easier, Amazon had 10x more books than any store, Apple put 10x better integrated design into the iPad. 
  * **Network Effects:** Two important points here. First, a product should become more useful as more people use it--you're more likely to use Facebook if your friends already are. However, the product still has to succeed in a small market--the company Xanadu (an early, quixotic attempt at the internet) failed because its technology could *only* work at scale, whereas Facebook gained traction within Harvard.
  * **Economies of Scale:** A monopoly must scale well, and this might be software's greatest advantage: while a restaurant's costs and challenges scale linearly, the cost of distributing more software is marginal. "A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design" (51).
  * **Branding:** The obvious paragon of branding today is Apple, thanks to minimalist design, premium price positioning, and (most of all) the "lingering nimbus of Steve Job's personal charisma" (52). But while hordes of startups have tried to emulate Apple's style, they've been taught it takes much more than just branding to succeed. Apple has the killer details that can uphold their image, from superior touchscreen materials to touchscreen interfaces designed for those materials. Moreover, they're supported by good network effects from App Store users and developers.

* Start Small    
  Every startup is small. Every monopoly dominates a market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market. "If you think your initial market might be too big, it almost certainly is" (53).

* But Not Too Small    
  With PayPal, they found that PalmPilot users were too disconnected a group to be a viable consumer base; hence the transition to eBay sellers. "The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors" (54). Beware of those who want to be a small fish in a big pond.

* Scaling Up    
  After dominance in a niche market is achieved, it's time to expand. When Amazon wanted to move on from books, it had two choices: "expand the number of people who read books, or expand to adjacent markets" (55). eBay started by dominating super-niche markets like Beanie Baby auctions, then slowly grew to serve all hobbyist trade.    
  > Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually. The most successful companies make the core progression a part of their founding narrative. (56)

* Don't Disrupt    
  Another one of Thiel's red flags. Disruption originally meant using new technology to introduce cheaper products that could overtake existing, more expensive options. Now it's voguish jargon used to attract attention.    
  Neither connotation is healthy for monopolist thinking. The former places too much focus on incumbent products: "if your company can be summed up by its opposition to already existing firms, it can't be completely new" and won't be a monopoly. The latter compels one to "look for trouble and find it" (57).

* Be the Last Mover   
  People think it pays to be the first mover in a market, to get a strong foothold before anyone else can react. But really, you want to focus on being the last mover, "to make the last great development" in that market (or as he says later on, to capture its key segment) (58).


### Chapter 6: You Are Not a Lottery Ticket (I/II)

* On the Causes of Success    
  For those like Malcolm Gladwell, success results from some "lucky breaks and arbitrary advantages" (why I found *Outliers* a somewhat vacuous read). Buffet, Gates, and Bezos offer similar platitudes, attributing their success to the "lucky sperm club", "ovarian lottery", and "incredible planetary alignment". Clearly cop-out answers, and Thiel agrees. He asserts that if success were purely accidental, we wouldn't see serial-billionares like Dorsey and Musk (although this statement seems logically unsound).

* What is Luck    
  As Emerson wrote:    
  > Shallow men believe in luck, believe in circumstances... Strong men believe in cause and effect.

  I always liked Milton's imagery: "luck is the residue of design". Thiel reflects on the long-standing history of such a sentiment--that luck is something to be mastered, dominated, and controlled. After all, "if you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book?" (61).

* Thinking About the Future    
  He gives 2 axes by which we judge the future.     
  The first is definitiveness: when you treat the future as something definite, it follows that you should work to understand and shape it. "But if you expect an indefinite future ruled by randomness, you'll give up on trying to master it"--and this is the prevailing attitude of society today, where "process trumps substance" and people try to assemble diverse portfolios of possible options au lieu of making concrete plans. For instance, students from middle school to college are told to have diverse extracurriculars, so that "come what may, he's ready--for nothing in particular") (62).    
  The second is optimism: whether or not you think the future will be better than the present.

* A Tale of Four Views    
  * **Indefinite Pessimism**    
    Aka Europe (sad but true), whose culture today is enslaved to the "myth of decline from some golden age". You don't know when or how this inevitable decline will occur, but it's going to happen, so you might as well "eat drink, and be merry in the meantime" (63).

  * **Definite Pessimism**    
    This is China today, where most people believe with certainty that the economy will be in trouble, taking action to prepare for the coming trouble. While the poor put everything into savings, the rich search desperately for ways to get their money out of the country--both are haunted by a lack of resources for a growing population, and a too-recent past of starvation.

  * **Definite Optimism**   
    This is the ideal attitude, and it's what Western society espoused in the mid-late 20th century. Everyone believed in a better future, and many took concrete action to pull that future closer. As Marx and Engels wondered how "such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor", new inventors and visionaries arose to tackle problems like ocean routes, skyscrapers and bridges, nuclear bombs, and space travel.

  * **Indefinite Optimism**    
    What characterizes the US today. To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn't know how exactly. "He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely" (68).
    How did we become indefinite? For Thiel it began with Baby Boomers, a generation who grew up with great expectations ("things got better every year for the first 18 years of your life, and *it had nothing to do with you*") but no specific plans on how to fulfill them (69). Instead of creating something new, they looked to restructure or optimize existing solutions.

* Perspective    
  Malcolm Gladwell says you can't understand Bill Gates' success without understanding his background. Thiel says you can't understand *Outliers* without understanding Gladwell's Baby Boomer mentality that success arises out of "the power of a particular individual's context as determined by chance" (69).    
  So what does all this say about Thiel? Perhaps his hatred of the education system was cultivated by the success of many of his Silicon Valley peers who forwent college (as well as the dissonance between his grueling education in law and his ultimate career path). Anyway, there's a good argument to be had on valuing breadth vs depth in school--I think having a base of general knowledge is useful for further learning and general life-awareness; but at the same time, finding a top job requires *only* substantial depth in one's field. Regardless, I think Thiel goes a little overboard with his critism of the college curiculum being too broad: maybe this is true in the Liberal Arts, but in my experience technical majors typically choose to be overly-confined within a specific domain.    
  Moreover, studying in the Bay has given me an impression of much-more definite optimism nowadays. What the future will look like is a frequent topic of discussion, and the prevalence of startups (and the success of this book) suggest that many are planning for it.


### Chapter 6: Our Indefinitely Optimistic World (II/II)

* Indefinite Finance    
  A definite future calls for the work of engineers, designing and building "underwater cities and settlements in space". On the other hand, an indefinite future exiges bankers and lawyers. "Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it's the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth" (70). Sure, people play in markets because they expect returns, but the market itself is ipso facto random--one can never make substantive, accurate forecasts, so the only solution is diversification.
  On a side note, I'm reminded of Prof. Burton Malkiel's *A Walk Down Wall Street*:    
  > A blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a newspaper's financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one carefully selected by experts.

  Such a study was later actually [conducted](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/en_us/publications/journal-papers/p_2013_aug_surprising_alpha.html); in it, Malkiel's monkeys performed even better than the human benchmark. Not really suprising, when even Econ 101 teaches that the vast majority of money managers lose money year on year.

* Indefinite Money    
  Picture this:    
  * An entrepreneur exits successfully.
  * Not knowing what to do with the money, he gives it to a large bank.
  * The bankers don't know either, so they divvy it between institution investors.
  * The investors don't know either, so they spread it across stock portfolios.
  Sound familiar? In this indefinite society, people want "unlimited optionality"--money itself--rather than anything you could do with it. "Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself" (71).

* Indefinite Politics    
  He criticizes the electoral process for becoming too short-minded: modern polling (s/o Nate Silver) has led politicians to focus on weekly voter sentiment rather than decades-long visions. And what happened to government programs? They used to take on problems like atomic weapons and lunar landings; now they can't even handle insurance. He points out the consistent decline of discretionary spending since 1975 as further signal of indefinite thinking.

* Indefinite Philosophy    
  The ancients like Plato and Aristotle believed in a pessimistic future. How should one deal with the many, stifling contraints on human existence?
  Later, philosophers like Spencer, Hegel, and Marx were bound by a belief in definite progress.    
  Nowadays, even philosophy is indefinite. He gives as examples John Rawls and Robert Nozick, both of whom lack concrete ideas about a better society (Rawl's "veil of ignorance" even goes as far to say that fair reasoning is impossible). They're concerned with processes, not results.

* Indefinite Life    
  Thiel says that while death used to be "something to defeat", nowadays we're resigned to it being both "inevitable and random" (74). This is pretty hard to believe, given how badly people want to stay alive (although I haven't done the research).    
  His more salient point is on biotech startups, who have stuck with the same approach to innovation as was used by Fleming in finding penicillin--waiting for luck to strike. Rather than find and test propitious hypotheses about the body, researchers have preferred brute-force trial and error (see "Eroom's Law: that the number of new drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&D has halved every nine years since 1950") (73). 

* Is Indefinite Optimism Even Possible?    
  "How can the future get better if no one plans for it?" (77). Thiel's answer: evolution. That slow, evolutionary progress occurs by default. I'm not sure about this one either; it seems more likely that even in an indefinite society, there will still be some entrepreneurs pushing forward.

* The Power of Planning    
  He brings up Steve Job's habit of ignoring media, peers, and public opinion in favor of his own long-term product plans.    
  > I think Henry Ford once said, "If I'd asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, 'A faster horse!'" People don't know what they want until you show it to them.

  The lesson here? Rely on design, not chance. (Not listening to the customer à la Jobs and Ford may work for select visionaries, but it's value to most entrepreneurs seems highly dubitable.)    
  > A startup is the largest endeavour over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.
