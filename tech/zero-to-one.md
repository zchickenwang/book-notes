### Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future

* *What very important truth do few people agree with you on? (5)*   
  One of Thiel's go-to interview questions, and pretty tough--intellectually because the truths that are taught are common, and psychologically because
  it's difficult to argue an unpopular opinion.

* *If nothing about our society changes fo the next 100 years, then the future
  is over 100 years away. (6)*   
  A clever pithy. Good reminder that we can't take progress for granted. He later harkens back to Americans in the 60's, echoing their expectations of "a four-day workweek, energy too cheap to meter, and vacations on the moon" (9). Damn. All they got instead were smaller computer chips. And just looking around at subways, street lights, buildings and houses, trash cans and sewage systems, even the way we cook and clean and work out... it does seem like our surroundings are "strangely old". Taken from Elon, perhaps?

* Horizontal vs Vertical Progress   
  Horizontal being copying "things that work", aka taking ideas from 1 to n, or globalisation; vertical being creating new things, aka going from 0 to 1, or technology. While we may find hope in horizontal progress, he argues that there simply aren't enough resources. "Globalisation without new technology is unsustainable" (9).

* The Power of 0 to 1   
  Primitive humans lived in a zero-sum society. Creating technology is how we add new sources of wealth, and thus increase the total.

* The Power of Staying Small   
  He punctuates the chapter by explaining why it takes a small company to produce technology. What is a fairly standard assessment nowadays. "A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future" (10).

* Some Reflections   
  Of course he's gonna talk about the next Google, Facebook, Amazon, but what about the 99.9% of startups whose mission is "just to" automate some testing framework, add a new feature to Postgres, buffer payment between a service and users? Where do they belong in his extensive/intensive binary? It's pretty hard not to get swept up in the book's grandiose visions and eulogies on immortality, but in practice most of us are rarely concerned with such idealisms. Helps one sell books (and stir up sidelined dreams), I guess. 
  This reminds me of Nietzsche's "The object of Mankind should lie in its highest individuals" (from his wife's introduction to Zarathustra). Individual achievement--yet another example of Thiel's power law in the flesh.
