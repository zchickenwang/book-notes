### Chapter 1: The Challenge of the Future

* *What very important truth do few people agree with you on? (5)*   
  One of Thiel's go-to interview questions, and pretty tough--intellectually because the truths that are taught are common, and psychologically because
  it's difficult to argue an unpopular opinion.

* *If nothing about our society changes fo the next 100 years, then the future
  is over 100 years away. (6)*   
  A clever pithy. Good reminder that we can't take progress for granted. He later harkens back to Americans in the 60's, echoing their expectations of "a four-day workweek, energy too cheap to meter, and vacations on the moon" (9). Damn. All they got instead were smaller computer chips. And just looking around at subways, street lights, buildings and houses, trash cans and sewage systems, even the way we cook and clean and work out... it does seem like our surroundings are "strangely old". Taken from Elon, perhaps?

* Horizontal vs Vertical Progress   
  Horizontal being copying "things that work", aka taking ideas from 1 to n, or globalisation; vertical being creating new things, aka going from 0 to 1, or technology. While we may find hope in horizontal progress, he argues that there simply aren't enough resources. "Globalisation without new technology is unsustainable" (9).

* The Power of 0 to 1   
  Primitive humans lived in a zero-sum society. Creating technology is how we add new sources of wealth, and thus increase the total.

* The Power of Staying Small   
  He punctuates the chapter by explaining why it takes a small company to produce technology. What is a fairly standard assessment nowadays. "A startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future" (10).

* Some Reflections   
  Of course he's gonna talk about the next GAFA, but what about the 99.9% of startups whose mission is "just to" automate some testing framework, add a new feature to Postgres, buffer payments between a service and users? Where do they belong in his extensive/intensive binary? It's pretty hard not to get swept up in Thiel's grandiose visions and eulogies on immortality, but in practice most of us are rarely concerned with such idealisms. Helps one sell books (and stir up sidelined dreams), I guess.   
  This reminds me of Nietzsche's "The object of Mankind should lie in its highest individuals" (from *Schopenhauer as Educator*). Individual achievement--yet another example of the power law in the flesh. 


### Chapter 2: Party Like It's 1999

* *"Madness is rare in individuals--but in groups, parties, nations, and ages it is the rule," Nietzsche wrote (before he went mad). (12)*     
  Thus, a good way of finding contrarian truths is identifying what everyone agrees on. He gives as example the 1990's "New Economy", where it became commonplace for companies to assume heavy losses for page views. As we know now, such thinking turned out to be a bubble (a conventional but incorrect belief).

* *But the distortion caused by bubbles don't disappear when they pop. (13)*      
  Interesting point here--and to a certain extent, we've taken measures aimed at avoiding the 2008 crisis (less voluntary regulation), but Thiel asks us to question if (1) we're misidentifying the causes of the crash, and (2) what could go wrong with a more-regulation approach? "The first step to thinking clearly is to question what we think we know about the past" (13).

* A Quick History    
  The 90's: US recession, jobs going to Mexico, dead soldiers, grunge & heroin, East Asian crises, the ruble fails, the euro fails, everything fails but IT. Then 18 months of dot-com mania, of sketchy startups and limitless money and red ink trophies. "But it's hard to blame people for dancing when the music was playing" (17).

* Paypal's Beginnings   
  The idea was to facilitate payments between PalmPilots. Turns out the market's too sparse, so pivot to email instead. Pay people to sign up and refer friends. Secured funding right before the bubble burst.

* Reactive Measures   
  He lists 4 big changes people made in response to the dot-com crash:
  * Make incremental advances (don't get cocky)
  * Stay lean (don't plan, it's all just "agnostic experimentation")
  * Improve on the competition (stick with existing markets)
  * Product, not sales (true technology distributes itself).

* Reactive Measures are wrong   
  Maybe. He argues that alternative beliefs are also valid:
  * Risk boldness
  * A bad plan is better than no plan
  * No profits in competition (see Chapter 4)
  * Sales matters (see Chapter 11).

* Some Reflections   
  The dogmas he talks about didn't end up lasting very long. I mean what's different about the bubble we're in now? Agile methodologies? The blind funding, viral marketing, early-stage losses, it all seems like that ethos has returned. Long live the dreamer.
